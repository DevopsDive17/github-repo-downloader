- **Minimal Dependencies**: Requires only `requests` and `git`.

---

## Requirements

- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
- Git installed and configured (`git --version` should work)

## Creating a GitHub Token (Optional)
While the script works without a token, GitHub limits the number of API requests for unauthenticated users.  
To create a token:
1. Go to **GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)**.
2. Click **Generate new token**.
3. Give it a name and select the **public_repo** scope (or **repo** for private repositories).
4. Click **Generate token** and copy the token.

---

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter `Rate Limit Exceeded`, try adding a GitHub Token.
- Make sure `git` is installed and accessible from your terminal.
